# Posie: A better guide to better posture
Posie is and AR Posture Tracking application that tracks body points and notifies the user to adjust sitting position.
The project is created by Anita Shen and Neha Nagabothu and implemented with Google Vision and Machine Learning classification.
Features include settings page to adjust tracking sensitivity, AR tracking log throughout each session, and AR body tracking page. Users simply have to place their device directly in front of their upper body and the app will generate heat maps of body joints, notifying the user when they hunch or slump over.
